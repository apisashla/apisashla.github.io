I don't know who I'd be apologizing to if I apologized for lack of content over the past couple months - most likely just the couple people who I already know look at this blog - and I'm not sure how much I should care in the first place, so I'll save it.

I've been wondering lately, if I were to express loyalty or thanks to something beyond the world we see, how I should go about it. There are always the old, obvious answers - food, drink, the odd bloodletting. Perhaps it'd be more effective if I were more regular about leaving food, but truth be told, it does feel like an empty gesture, especially since I don't know for certain to whom I'm leaving it.
