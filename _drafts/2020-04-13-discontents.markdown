If you haven't figured it out already, this blog is not intended to be a project where I'm afraid to say something simply because someone else may have said it better elsewhere. I think that mindset, which I've operated in too often, is a huge barrier to actually thinking creatively. That is, if you never fall into ruts someone else has dug, then you will never find your way out of any either.

With that out of the way, today I'm on a topic which has been discussed in one capacity or another since the beginning of recorded human history - religion and what it means to me.

I was raised Latter-Day Saint. Plenty can and probably will be written on that experience on its own, but the long and short of it is that I believed very strongly from a very young age that, whatever happened, the world would fundamentally be okay eventually, that people would get what they deserved in the next life if not this one, that miracles existed and could be exercised and seen in everyday life, that families were the perfect divine unit and would last forever. This shaped my early political development as well - as a conservative, then a libertarian, I believed in a divine destiny for the United States and the world systems it sustains,and in a uniquely American view of freedom and personal responsibility, implemented neatly and uniformly across the various spheres of life.

As you might imagine from my use of the past tense, at some point life became more complicated. The contradictions between my friendships with LGBT people and my beliefs, in particular, placed a strain on my convictions and eventually served as spiderweb cracks thaat developed into gaping rifts between my actions and feelings, and the identity I'd built for myself. Even well after the whole thing came tumbling down, it took me a long time to realize I'd been raised in one of the most profitable and successful cults in the world.

And yet.

The trouble with being raised to see signs of the times and miracles in the day-to-day is that it doesn't stop there. I'm still reaching for something close to the community I was part of before, of the unity and integrity (not in the sense of truth, but in the sense of having a self-consistent self) that came from absolute acceptance of a divine force in my life.
