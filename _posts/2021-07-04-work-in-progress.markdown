Hi! I've come back to this blog after a long absence, and because of changes made on the backend of Jekyll, Ruby, github pages and so forth, I'm thinking the best way to tackle this may be to rebuild the site. Comments will be lost, but posts may not be (I say "may not" because I've copied them but may decide to simply archive them for my own use and remove them. We'll see what I decide is worth putting back up.)

The easiest thing would be to rebuild using github pages and Jekyll again (a straight upgrade won't work very well, because github doesn't yet support the newest versions of Jekyll, which causes things to break because Jekyll now relies on newer versions of Ruby.) I may, however, decide to go with a different hosting provider. Not sure yet. It'll still be deployed to the same domain name, so don't worry about that part.

Thanks for bearing with me, and see you on the flip side.
